## 2026-01-08 - Complete Rules System Refactor + Agent Inference Fix

- **Phase**: Architecture redesign
- **Agent**: Backend + Documentation
- **Major Work**:
  - Refactored entire rules system to be modular
  - Source files in src/rules/*.md
  - ai-workflow.md: Complete auto-initialization (9 steps)
  - project-config.md: Hierarchical ad.yaml documentation
  - project-structure.md: Feature-driven structure
  - Generated all IDE configs (claude.md, .cursorrules, etc.) from source
- **Testing**: Auto-initialization system
  - Deleted ad.yaml to trigger auto-initialization
  - Created ad.yaml with domain: software, mode: feature
  - Reorganized docs/ structure
  - Updated journal.md and decisions.md
- **Bug Found**: Agent configuration not included during auto-initialization
  - Only 4 questions asked (missing question 5 about agents)
  - No agent inference logic in Step 3
  - Step 5 hardcoded `agents: enabled: false`
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Added question 5: "Do you want to use multi-agent workflows?"
  - Removed ALL automatic agent detection (was software-specific, not generic)
  - Step 3: Simplified to just enable/disable based on user choice
  - Step 5: Generate agents section with:
    - `team: []` empty array for manual configuration
    - Helpful comments with examples for different domains:
      - Software: backend-dev, frontend-dev, qa-engineer, devops
      - Books: chapter-writers, editor, designer, publisher
      - Marketing: content-creator, designer, analyst, campaign-manager
      - Events: logistics, promotion, program, registration
  - Step 9: Notify user that agents need manual configuration
  - Rules are now completely domain-agnostic - work for ANY project type
  - No assumptions about project structure
  - User configures agents based on their specific needs
  - Regenerated all IDE configs with fixed rules
  - Updated claude.md in root with generic agent initialization
- **Decisions**: ADR-002: Enable multi-agent without automatic detection (domain-agnostic)
- **Next**: Continue refining auto-initialization based on real-world usage
  
- **Decisions**:
  - Rules are source .md files, not single claude.md
  - generate-ide-configs.sh concatenates all .md files
  - All IDEs get the same comprehensive rules (42KB)
  - Auto-initialization is now the first step in AI workflow
  
- **Templates Created**:
  - templates/root-ad.yaml: Complete commented template
  - templates/feature-ad.yaml: Complete commented template
  
- **Next**: Test auto-initialization with a real project

## 2026-01-08 - AD Initialization (Auto-initialized)

- **Action**: Initialized AD for existing project
- **Domain**: software
- **Mode**: feature-driven
- **Detected Features**: 0 (starting fresh)
- **Current Phase**: BUILD (inferred from codebase analysis)

### What was done:
- Created ad.yaml (root configuration)
- Created docs/conventions.md
- Organized docs/ structure (active/, completed/, planning/, archived/)
- No features detected yet (user chose to start fresh)

### Next Steps:
- Review auto-generated ad.yaml configuration
- Start first feature with: "I want to work on [feature-name]"
- Continue development with AD workflow
