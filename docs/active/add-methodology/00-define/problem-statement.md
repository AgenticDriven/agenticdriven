# Problem Statement

## The Problem

Development teams working with AI agents lack a structured methodology to organize their work. Current approaches are ad-hoc, leading to:

- **Lack of clear phases**: Teams don't know where they are in the project lifecycle
- **Poor documentation**: Progress and decisions are not properly tracked
- **No standardization**: Each team invents their own process
- **Difficult collaboration**: Multiple agents working together without clear contracts
- **Version chaos**: No clear versioning system that reflects project progress

## Who is Affected

- **Software developers** using AI coding assistants
- **Content creators** working with AI writing tools
- **Product teams** building with AI support
- **Any professional** collaborating with AI agents on structured projects

## Current State

Teams currently either:
1. Use traditional methodologies (Agile, Waterfall) not designed for AI collaboration
2. Work without any methodology, leading to chaos
3. Try to adapt existing frameworks unsuccessfully

## Desired State

A universal methodology that:
- Provides clear phases from problem definition to release
- Works for any domain (software, content, products, etc.)
- Includes AI-agent collaboration patterns
- Has built-in documentation and versioning
- Is simple enough to adopt immediately
- Is flexible enough to adapt to any project

## Impact

Without a solution:
- Projects take longer than necessary
- Quality suffers from lack of structure
- Teams waste time inventing processes
- AI agent potential is underutilized
- Knowledge is lost between projects
