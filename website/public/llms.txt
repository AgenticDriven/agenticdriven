# Agentic Driven (AD) 1.0

> The first AI-native methodology for structured development with AI agents.

Agentic Driven (AD) is a universal methodology designed for effective human-AI collaboration. It provides clear structure for any project type: software, content, marketing, events, and more.

## 7 Core Principles

1. **Agentic-Driven**: AI agent leads execution, human supervises and decides strategy
2. **Documentation-First**: Document before implementing, update docs with code
3. **Context-Aware**: Manage AI context explicitly via ad.yaml context_files
4. **Contract-Driven**: Define interfaces in docs/interfaces.md before implementation
5. **Continuous Validation**: Validate at every step, exit criteria gate phase transitions
6. **Git-Traceable**: Everything tracked in git with Conventional Commits and semantic versioning
7. **Standards-First**: Use established standards (Conventional Commits, JSON:API, ISO-8601, semver)

## 6 Development Phases

```
v0.0.x → DEFINE      Define problem, objectives, scope
v0.1.x → DISCOVER    Investigate options, viability
v0.2.x → DESIGN      Design solution, architecture
v0.3.x → SETUP       Prepare development and validation infrastructure
v0.4.x → BUILD       Build/create solution
v0.5.x → VALIDATE    Verify quality, testing
v1.0.0 → RELEASE     First stable version
```

## Quick Install

```bash
# Download for any IDE
curl -sSL https://agenticdriven.dev/download.sh | bash -s <ide>

# Examples
curl -sSL https://agenticdriven.dev/download.sh | bash -s cursor
curl -sSL https://agenticdriven.dev/download.sh | bash -s claude
```

## Project Configuration (ad.yaml)

```yaml
domain: "software"  # software | book | marketing | event | product | research | course | game
mode: "feature"     # feature | project

context_files:
  - "README.md"
  - "docs/decisions.md"

active_features:
  - path: "docs/active/feature-name"
    description: "Feature description"
    status: "in-progress"

agents:
  enabled: false
```

## Key Concepts

- **ad.yaml**: Project configuration file defining domain, mode, features, and agent settings
- **context_files**: Files AI agents should read to understand the project
- **Exit Criteria**: Requirements to complete before advancing to next phase
- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit message format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Semantic Versioning**: v0.PHASE.ITERATION during development, v1.0.0+ after release
