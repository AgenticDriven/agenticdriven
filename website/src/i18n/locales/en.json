    "subtitle": "A structured methodology designed specifically for AI-agent collaboration",
    "lead": "<strong>Agentic Driven Workflow (ADW)</strong> is the first universal methodology created for the AI era. It provides clear structure through <strong>13 principles</strong> and <strong>10 phases</strong> that work for any project—software, content, marketing, events, and more.",
    "p1": "Traditional methodologies like Agile and Waterfall weren't designed for AI collaboration. They assume humans write code and make every decision. ADW flips this: <strong>humans define strategy, AI executes</strong>.",
    "p2": "Whether you're building an app with Cursor, writing a book with Claude, or managing a project with Copilot, ADW gives you the framework to work effectively with AI agents.",
