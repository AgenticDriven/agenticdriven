# Agentic Driven (AD) - Root Configuration
# This file configures the AD methodology for your project

# =============================================================================
# DOMAIN - What type of project is this?
# =============================================================================
# Adapts AI language and workflow to your domain
# Values: software | book | marketing | event | product | research | course | game
domain: "software"

# =============================================================================
# MODE - How do you organize work?
# =============================================================================
# feature: Work on individual features with their own mini-cycles (recommended)
# project: Complete all 10 phases for entire project (classic waterfall-style)
mode: "feature"

# =============================================================================
# CONTEXT FILES - Global documentation read at every session start
# =============================================================================
# These files are read by ALL features and agents
# Keep list minimal - only truly global docs
context_files:
  - "README.md"
  - "docs/decisions.md"
  - "docs/conventions.md"
  - "docs/journal.md"

# =============================================================================
# ACTIVE FEATURES - Features currently in progress
# =============================================================================
# Each feature has its own directory with ad.yaml
# Example:
# active_features:
#   - path: "docs/active/user-authentication"
#     description: "JWT-based user authentication system"
#     status: "in-progress"    # in-progress | blocked | review
#
#   - path: "docs/active/payment-integration"
#     description: "Stripe payment processing"
#     status: "blocked"
active_features: []

# =============================================================================
# COMPLETED FEATURES - Finished features (moved from active)
# =============================================================================
# Track what's been completed and when
# Example:
# completed_features:
#   - path: "docs/completed/initial-setup"
#     completed_at: "2026-01-08"
#     description: "Project initialization and structure"
completed_features: []

# =============================================================================
# AGENTS - Multi-agent workflow configuration
# =============================================================================
agents:
  # Enable multi-agent workflows (true | false)
  enabled: true

  # Platform: claude-sdk | windsurf | cursor
  # Determines which agent coordination system to use
  platform: "claude-sdk"

  # Execution mode: parallel | sequential | hybrid
  # parallel: All agents work simultaneously
  # sequential: One agent at a time
  # hybrid: Mix of both based on dependencies
  default_execution_mode: "parallel"

  # Coordination technique: message-passing | shared-state | pipeline
  # message-passing: Agents communicate via git commits and docs
  # shared-state: Agents share a common state file
  # pipeline: Output of one agent feeds into next
  default_coordination: "message-passing"

  # Team configuration - Define agents based on your project's areas of work
  # Each agent should have:
  # - id: unique identifier (kebab-case)
  # - role: what kind of work this agent does
  # - description: brief explanation
  # - phases: which AD phases this agent participates in
  # - capabilities: what this agent can do
  # - context_dirs: directories this agent focuses on
  team:
    # Example: Methodology development agent (specific to this AD project)
    - id: "methodology-dev"
      role: "methodology-development"
      description: "Develops AD methodology rules and architecture"
      phases: ["DEFINE", "DISCOVER", "DESIGN", "BUILD"]
      capabilities: ["rules-writing", "architecture-design", "documentation"]
      context_dirs:
        - "src/rules/"
        - "docs/planning/"

    # Example: Website development agent (specific to this AD project)
    - id: "website-dev"
      role: "website-implementation"
      description: "Maintains website and public documentation"
      phases: ["BUILD", "VALIDATE", "MARKET"]
      capabilities: ["frontend", "documentation", "deployment"]
      context_dirs:
        - "website/"

    # Example: Templates management agent (specific to this AD project)
    - id: "templates-dev"
      role: "templates-management"
      description: "Creates and maintains configuration templates"
      phases: ["DESIGN", "BUILD"]
      capabilities: ["yaml-design", "template-creation"]
      context_dirs:
        - "templates/"
