# Contracts

## File: docs/interfaces.md

Required for multi-agent. Define specifications before implementation.

## Format

```markdown
## Interface: Name
**Input**: What goes in
**Output**: What comes out
**Errors**: Possible failures
```

## Workflow

DESIGN: Define contracts, review, commit
BUILD: Read contracts, implement, use mocks for unimplemented deps

Never deviate without updating contract first.
