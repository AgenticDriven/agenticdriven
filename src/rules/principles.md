# Principles

**1. Agent-Driven**: Humans decide strategy, AI executes
**2. Documentation-First**: Document before, during, after
**3. Phased & Structured**: 6 phases with clear objectives and exit criteria
**4. Validation-Driven**: Validate before building and what's built
**5. Iterative**: Improve within phases, document if going back
**6. Traceable**: Every change in git with clear history
**7. Git-First**: Complete + verify = commit immediately. One commit per completed task.
**8. Standards-First**: Always prefer rigid standards: Conventional Commits, JSON:API, ISO-8601, semver, established patterns
**9. Explicit over Implicit**: No magic numbers/strings, define terms before use, named constants
**10. Single Responsibility**: One component = one purpose. Keep small and focused.
**11. Contract-Driven**: Define specifications in `docs/interfaces.md` before implementation. Implement exactly to spec.
**12. Test-First**: Define success criteria before starting. Validate during work.
**13. Proven Solutions First**: Use established solutions: design patterns, proven frameworks, standard structures
