**VALIDATE**: All tests passing, coverage met (80%+), performance acceptable, validation report complete, stakeholders approve
**MARKET**: Materials created, docs complete, strategy defined, channels prepared, ready to launch
**LAUNCH**: Deployed, monitoring active, metrics collected, no critical issues, ready for support

## Validation

Before advancing:
1. Review checklist
2. Verify items complete
3. Document exceptions
4. Get approval
5. Commit final work
6. Tag completion
7. Update to next phase

```bash
git commit -m "docs: complete DESIGN exit criteria"
git tag -a v0.2.9 -m "DESIGN complete"
git commit -m "chore: start SETUP (v0.3.0)"
```

## Flexibility

Guidelines, not rigid rules. Adapt to project needs. Document deviations. Focus on quality.
