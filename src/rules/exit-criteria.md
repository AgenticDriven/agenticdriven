# Exit Criteria

## By Phase

**DEFINE**: Problem stated, objectives defined, scope documented, success criteria clear

**DISCOVER**: Requirements gathered, options researched, feasibility assessed, risks identified

**DESIGN**: Solution designed, architecture defined, interfaces specified in docs/interfaces.md

**SETUP**:
- Development environment functional (dependencies installed, configs working)
- ad.yaml with context_files defined
- Test framework configured with first test passing
- CI pipeline basic (lint, test, build)
- Validation criteria documented
- Project structure scaffolded per DESIGN

**BUILD**: All components implemented, contracts fulfilled, docs updated, tests passing

**VALIDATE**: Validation criteria met, quality acceptable, report complete, ready for release

## Validation Process

Before advancing phase:
1. Review checklist for current phase
2. Verify all criteria complete
3. Document any exceptions
4. Get human approval
5. Commit and tag (v0.X.0)

Guidelines, not rigid rules. Adapt to project needs.
