# Exit Criteria

## By Phase

**DEFINE**: Problem stated, objectives defined, scope documented, constraints identified, success criteria defined
**DISCOVER**: Requirements gathered, options researched, feasibility assessed, decisions documented, risks identified
**DESIGN**: Solution designed, architecture defined, interfaces specified, design approved, ready to build
**SETUP**: Tools configured, environment ready, validation criteria defined, team ready
**BUILD**: All components implemented, contracts fulfilled, docs updated, reviewed
**VALIDATE**: Validation criteria met, quality acceptable, validation report complete, stakeholders approve
**MARKET**: Materials created, docs complete, strategy defined, channels prepared, ready to launch
**LAUNCH**: Deployed, monitoring active, metrics collected, no critical issues, ready for support
**SUPPORT**: Stable period complete, critical issues resolved, support working, feedback collected, ready to evolve
**EVOLVE**: Improvements implemented, optimized, features added, roadmap updated, lessons documented

## Validation

Before advancing:
1. Review checklist
2. Verify items complete
3. Document exceptions
4. Get approval
5. Commit final work
6. Update to next phase

```bash
git commit -m "docs: complete DESIGN exit criteria"
git commit -m "chore: start SETUP (v0.3.0)"
```

## Flexibility

Guidelines, not rigid rules. Adapt to project needs. Document deviations. Focus on quality.
