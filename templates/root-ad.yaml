# Agentic Driven (AD) 1.0 - Root Configuration
# This file manages the overall project state and links to active features

# ========================================
# PROJECT CONFIGURATION
# ========================================

# Domain: Type of project (adapts AI language and workflow)
# Valid values: software, book, marketing, event, product, research, course, game
domain: "software"

# Mode: How to organize work
# - feature: Work on individual features (recommended for most projects)
# - project: Complete all 10 phases for the entire project (classic approach)
mode: "feature"

# Version: Overall project version (only used in project mode)
# In feature mode, each feature has its own version
version: "v0.0.0"

# ========================================
# GLOBAL CONTEXT FILES
# ========================================

# Files that provide context for ALL features
# These are read at session start by the AI
# Add important global documentation here
context_files:
  - "README.md"
  - "docs/decisions.md"
  - "docs/conventions.md"
  # - "docs/interfaces.md"  # Add if using multi-agent

# ========================================
# ACTIVE FEATURES
# ========================================

# Features currently in progress
# Each feature has its own ad.yaml in docs/active/feature-name/
active_features: []
  # Example:
  # - path: "docs/active/user-auth"
  #   description: "JWT-based authentication system"
  #   status: "in-progress"  # in-progress | blocked | testing | review

# ========================================
# COMPLETED FEATURES
# ========================================

# Features that have been completed
# Moved here from active_features when done
completed_features: []
  # Example:
  # - path: "docs/completed/initial-setup"
  #   completed_at: "2026-01-08"
  #   description: "Project initialization and setup"

# ========================================
# MULTI-AGENT CONFIGURATION (Optional)
# ========================================

# Only needed if using multiple AI agents working in parallel
# Leave disabled for solo development
agents:
  enabled: false

  # When enabled, configure:
  # default_execution_mode: "parallel"  # parallel | sequential | hybrid
  # default_coordination: "message-passing"  # message-passing | shared-state | pipeline
  # platform: "claude-sdk"  # claude-sdk | windsurf | cursor | manual
